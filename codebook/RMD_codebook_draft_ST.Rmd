# Overview

## Longitudinal Study Background  

This study is a longitudinal extension which aims to further our understanding of trajectories of adult offending in a sample of 158 (n = 8 participants are now deceased) women who participated in a randomized intervention trial aimed at reducing conduct problems and delinquency during adolescence. The study was originally supported and funded through the Oregon Youth Authority and by Grant R01 DA015208 (P.I., Patricia Chamberlain, Ph.D.) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and by Grant R01 MH054257 (P.I., Patricia Chamberlain, Ph.D.) from the National Institute of Mental Health. In the original study, juvenile justice involved girls ages 13 â€“ 17 who had been referred for out-of-home placement due to chronic delinquency were randomly assigned to participate in services as usual (group care; GC) or in Treatment Foster Care Oregon (TFCO, Chamberlain, 2003). The first extension of this longitudinal study was funded by Grant R01 DA024672 (P.I., Leslie Leve, Ph.D.). That study examined the developmental pathways of risk for juvenile justice involved girls into young adulthood with the original participants who were at the time, ages 16-29 years.


## Study Goals 

-   **Goal 1** Explore the constellation of risk factors and risk processes in the lives of adult women with histories in the juvenile justice system 

-   **Goal 2** Identify potential turning points across adulthood in the lives of adult women with histories in the juvenile justice system. 

-   **Goal 3** Understand how justice involvement is related to women's health outcomes, including biological indicators of health and stress.

-   **Goal 4** Examine the potential long-term impact of Treatment Foster Care Oregon, a gender-specific intervention.

## Data Collection Activities in this Wave  

There were two assessment activities. 

**Telephone Interview**

-   First, one telephone interview was conducted with original participants (*M* = 18 years after each participantsâ€™ baseline assessment). This interview lasted approximately 2 hours and included an assessment of the following constructs: parenting, partner characteristics, health-risking behaviors, mental health and trauma/victimization experiences, and public system involvement. 
-   In this assessment wave, we consented 133 participants of the 158 original participants who are living (84% retention). Of those, 130 participants completed the telephone portion of the assessment. Additionally, we were able to partner with the state department of corrections and interview all participants who were currently incarcerated in prison systems (*n* = 4).

**Biological Assessment**

-   The second part of the assessment was a 1 hour biological and physical health assessment. While prior waves collected limited information on self-reported health, this longitudinal extension also included a more robust battery of health conditions and a robust battery of 12 biomarkers, used to assess allostatic load, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune system function. This biological assessment was conducted either in person or virtually due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
-   123 participants completed the biological assessment. Two of the four participants who were incarcerated also completed a small portion of the *self-report* (not biological) measures from the biological assessment, thus our total analytic file for the biological assessment is *n* = 125.  


  

## Data and Codebook Guide


### Introduction to Codebook Structure

This document provides a summary of each measure assessed in the Turning Points for Women Study. Most of the measures described here have actual or potential computed scale scores. Some measures, however, are simply collections of individual items (e.g., demographic variables). We have tried to use the official name of each measure as the heading for each section; many measures, however, do not have official names and therefore the chosen name is arbitrary. If you cannot find a study measure in the table of contents, you may want to search for a keyword in this document.

For each measure, this document typically contains the following descriptive information:

-   A brief description of what the instrument measures  

-   Pertinent references  

-   All measures were collected from the original study participant unless otherwise indicated  

-   Variable name, variable description, and notes about the variable, for example, if a variable should be reverse scored or if a variable was not adminstered to participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment   

-   Description of how missing data is coded and handled in scale scores. Generally, this information is covered in the introductory materials as missing codes are consistent across *all* study variables, but if exceptions apply, they will be noted in the cleaning script and this codebook.  

-   Formulas for creating scale scores and the resulting variables  

-   Coefficient alphas of scales or subscale scores and notes about their distribution and valid ranges of the data  


### Missing Data

-   Truly missing = `NA` (blank in file or -99): The question should
    have been asked of the respondent, but for a reason other than those
    listed below, no answer was given or recorded.

    This -99 is also given in the case of a computed subscale or total
    score or other summary when the percentage of missing data is
    outside what is allowable for missing data rules

-   Not Applicable = -55: The subject was never asked a question for
    some reason (most often conditional question [skip rules])

-   Don't Know = -66: The subject was unable to answer a question,
    either because he or she had no opinion or because the required
    information was not available (could not recall).

-   Refusal/No Answer = -77: The subject explicitly refused to answer a
    question or did not answer it when he or she should have.

-   Processing Error = -44: For some reason, there is no answer to the
    question, although the subject provided one. This can result from
    interviewer error, incorrect coding, machine failure, or other
    problems. This code does not exist in our data.
    
-   **Important Note:** Data users should ensure that missing data values (all negative numbers in this dataset) are not being analyzed as valid numeric values prior to analyzing any data in the files associated with this study.

### Missing Data Rule

For summary or subscale scores that are computed with individual items, any of the above reasons are included in computing the percent of missing data. The following missing data rules are below and follow procedures used throughout the history of this longitudinal study. In some cases, measure specific guidelines for handling missing data were used when those guidelines were more stringent. Exceptions are called out within individual measure documentation.

Note that we have made every effort to archive individual-level items so that users of the data can compute summary scores and complete analyses using a variety of modern missing data methods (e.g., imputation).  

-   For scales with [10 or more items]{.underline}, a composite score
    (average/total) is computed for each participant that have less than
    [20%]{.underline} of the items from that measure missing

-   For scales with [7 to 9 items]{.underline}, a composite score
    (average/total) is computed for each participant that have less than
    [30%]{.underline} of the items from that measure missing

-   For scales with [3 to 6 items]{.underline}, a composite score
    (average/total) is computed for each participant that have less than
    [33%]{.underline} of the items from that measure missing

-   For scales with [only 2 items]{.underline}, composite scores
    (average/total) are calculated on a [case by case basis]{.underline}

### Data Use Notes and Disclaimers

Because the use of and development of measures is ever evolving and there exist many ways to analyze data, we have made every effort to archive individual-level items so that users of the data can compute summary scores according to preferred methods, latest empirical findings, and recommended best practices, including the handling of missing data. Users are also encouraged to thoroughly read the data documentation and perform data checks for outliers, out-of-range values, and to determine if any cases should be excluded from analyses based on checks with relevant criteria for research questions or analyses of interest. Users are encouraged to query the study author if questions arise.

# Characteristics of Living

At every wave of this longitudinal study, we asked participants about each place they had lived, even if for only one night. We asked them the date they entered and left each location, and we coded the type of location(s). In this assessment, we started with their last known location and the date we had last interviewed each participant.

- Below we provide the variables computed for those data, including the total number of transitions from one location to the next each participant had reported, since the last assessment wave (approximately 2015), and the number of times each participant reported being incarcerated in a jail or prison, or being unhoused.

# CINT 

CINT is our study name for 'Child Interview' and refers to an assessor administered interview that has been delivered to our participants at each wave of the longitudinal study, with some slight variation according to developmental stage and the focus of each assessment. This CINT interview includes information about demographics, substance use, and relationship variables. 

## CINT-Sociodemographics (CINT-SOCIO)

### CINT-SOCIO Description


-   Numbering retains the original numbers as the data were collected. Although the numbers are slightly out of order and appear to be missing items, this is by design as other CINT items are documented in other CINT sections or are variables that were for skip rules or screening only. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This is not a standardized questionnaire, so the missing data rule was not applied. No total or subscale scores were computed.

## CINT-Subjective Socioeconomic Status (CINT-SSES)
  
  
### CINT-SSES Description
  
To assess subjective socioeconomic status (SES), the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status â€“ Adult Version was administered as part of the CINT.

-   There are two items. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This measure has two single items, thus the missing data rule was not applicable. One participant is missing data. No total scores or subscales were computed. 

-   Participants rated themselves 1-10 using the image of a ladder shown below, with higher numbers indicating greater subjective socioeconomic status.

```{r ladder image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("ladder_image.jpg")
```

## CINT-Relationship (CINT-R)

  
### CINT-R Description
  
This set of questions was administered as part of the CINT focus on the participant's relationships.

-   There are 18 items. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This measure is not a standardized questionnaire with scoring, thus the missing data rule was not applicable. No total scores or subscales were computed.

## CINT-Substances (CINT-Sub)

### CINT-Sub Description

This set of questions was administered as part of the CINT's focus on the participant's substance use. All questions for substance use were drawn from an unpublished measure  but are aligned with typical retrospective reports of substance use similar to the widely used Timeline Follow-Back procedure (Sobell and Sobell, 1992).

-   There are 49 items. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This measure is not a standardized questionnaire with scoring, thus the missing data rule was not applicable. No total scores or subscales were computed. 

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment.

## CINT-COVID (EPII)

  
### Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)
  
This survey was administered as part of the CINT. As shared in the original publication, the EPII is a newly developed measure designed to learn about the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic and future epidemics and pandemics on various domains of personal and family life. Because the EPII is a newly developed measure, there are no psychometric properties yet available and optimal scoring procedures are not yet determined. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This is not a a standardized questionnaire, so the missing data rules were not applied. No total or subscale scores were computed 

-   The original measure contains 14 items. We have cleaned the data to create dichotomous variables for the impact on self and others. In the administration of the survey, participants were read each item once and asked if changes impacted the participant (_self), another person in their home (_other), or did not affect them.

# Delinquency and Crime 

## Elliott Delinquency Scale Self Report (EDS-SR)

### EDS-SR Description

The Self-Reported Delinquency Scale was designed to measure participantsâ€™ delinquent activities, tapping the areas of property damage, theft, assault, and substance use. For each type of delinquent act, the participant is asked how many times in the past six months they had participated in the delinquent act. When a participant endorsed 10 or more times, they were asked a follow up question (variables ending in `a`).

-   For the present study, 39 items were administered, with 38 additional follow-up items for all original items except for `ell23`. There are a total of 80 EDS-SR items in this dataset, together with the computed scales.  

-   Items for participant's report on their own behaviors use the prefix `ell`

-   **Higher** values for each item indicate **greater**  delinquency. 

-   The missing data rules were applied when scoring the measure.

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. 

-   Item numbers in this dataset may not always match original item numbers from the EDS. Please reference this guide to see match with original EDS (original EDS item number in *italics*): 01 = *01*, 02 = *03*, 03 = *04*, 04 = *05*, 05 = *06*, 06 = *07*, 07 = *08*, 08 = *09*, 09 = *10*, 10 = *11*, 11 = *12*, 12 = *13*, 13 = N/A, 14 = *14*, 15 = *15*, 16 = *16*, 17 = *17*, 18 = *19*, 19 = *20*, 20 = *22*, 21 = *24*, 22 = *25*, 23 = N/A, 24 = *26*, 25 = *27*, 26 = *28*, 27 = *29*, 28 = *30*, 29 = *32*, 30 = *34*, 31 = *35*, 32 = *37*, 33 = *38*, 34 = *40*, 35 = *41*, 36 = *42*, 37 = *43*, 38 = *44*, 39 = *45*

-   There are various ways to score the EDS measure. We have provided three scored variables:

    + **EDS-SR Total Score** (`ell_raw_total`) is a sum of the total number of delinquent acts for all items except ell23
    + **Total Index Offenses** (`ell_total_index_offenses`) is a total of 9 items that are considered to be index (more severe) crimes.
    + **Total Minor Offenses** (`ell_total_minor_offenses`) is a sum of 29 items that are considered to be minor crimes.

### EDS-SR Variables

#### Value Labels

Response options for items that end with an `a`, with the exception of `ell23` are presented below. These questions were asked for any item(s) that a participant endorsed doing 10 or more times in the past six months.

```{r ELL-label-table, results = 'asis'}
ell_label_df <- data.frame(
  value = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"),
  label = c("Once a month",
            "Once every 2-3 weeks",
            "Once a week",
            "2-3 times a day",
            "Once a day",
            "2-3 times a day")) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

ell_label_df <- setNames(ell_label_df[-1, ], unlist(ell_label_df[1, ]))


#create table
ell_label_table <- ell_label_df %>%
  gt() %>% 
  tab_options(table.border.top.width = 1, table.border.bottom.width = 1,
              table.border.left.width = 1, table.border.right.width = 1) %>% 
  #cols_width(everything() ~ px(180)) %>% 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100))%>%
  apply_labtab_theme()

# Print the table
print(ell_label_table)


```

This is the response option for `ell23`

```{r ELL23-label-table, results = 'asis'}


ell23_label_df <- data.frame(
  value = c("1", "2", "3"),
  label = c("Only threatened to hit",
            "Tried but didn't succeed",
            "Actually hit")) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

ell23_label_df <- setNames(ell23_label_df[-1, ], unlist(ell23_label_df[1, ]))


#create table
ell23_label_table <- ell23_label_df %>%
  gt() %>% 
  tab_options(table.border.top.width = 1, table.border.bottom.width = 1,
              table.border.left.width = 1, table.border.right.width = 1) %>% 
  #cols_width(everything() ~ px(150)) %>% 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100))%>%
  apply_labtab_theme()

# Print the table
print(ell23_label_table)
```

#### Survey Items

EDS-SR survey items are presented in the following table. Variables that do not end with `a` are open text. Variables that end with an `a` were only asked for items for which a participant endorsed the item 10 or more times. 

```{r ell-var-prep}

         notes = as.character("")) %>% 
  mutate(description = gsub("ASSESSOR NOTE.*","",description)) %>%
  mutate(description = if_else(var_name == "ell10", "How many times in the last 6 months have you attacked someone with the idea
of seriously hurting or killing that person?", description))

## Elliott Delinquency Scale Friends/Peers (EDS-F)

### EDS-F Description

The Self-Reported Delinquency measure (participant report on friends [EDS-F]) was designed to measure participantsâ€™ friends' delinquent activities, tapping the areas of property damage, theft, assault, and substance use. For each type of delinquent act, the participant is asked how many of the participant's friend(s) had ever committed the delinquent act.

-   For the present study, 39 items were included. Items use the prefix `elf`

-   All 39 items needed to be reverse scored based on how the original data was collected. Since the reverse scoring applied to **all** variables, we did not save reverse scored data in separate variable, all data in the data file are already reverse scored.

-   **Higher** values for each item indicate **greater** friend/peer delinquency. 

-   Because no scale scores were computed, the missing data rules were note applied.

## Adult Criminal Legal System Records Data

Information on arrests, charges, dispositions, and incarceration were sought from the adult criminal legal system in each state/county where the participant had self-reported residing since the last assessment wave. For each participant, all identified offenses (charges) were collated, the offense date, arrest/referral status for each offense, disposition(s), when available were coded. When fines,  jail, prison, or probation were sentenced and the information was provided, the amount/ length of the sentence was recorded. 

-   Offenses were coded according to the severity of the offense (e.g., 1-status offenses, 2 - law violations/U misdemeanors; 3-5 misdemeanor offenses, 6-9 felony offenses) 

-   Offenses were also coded according to the type of offense using methods that have been used in the history of this longitudinal study (see reference below) 

-   Values that are not applicable are `-55` (for example, a participant who has not had an adult offense, does not have an age at first adult offense (any `F18_` or `FF18` variables))


Reference: Arrest Codes; OSLC unpublished coding scheme 

Value label for `Wave14Desist`. All other values are numeric.

```{r arrest-label-table, results = 'asis'}
arrest_label_df <- data.frame(
  value = c("0", "1"),
  label = c("Did not desist",
            "Desisted (no new offenses since last assessment wave)")) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

  tab_options(table.width = pct(100))%>%
  apply_labtab_theme()

# Print the table

## Self-Reported Arrests (ARRIL)

At every wave of this young adult and adult assessments in this study, we asked participants if they had been arrested since the last assessment, how many times they had been arrested, and the date, location, and nature of those arrests. 

- Below we provide the variables in the data related to self-reported arrests. Please note that sometimes participants consider 'arrests' to be 'offenses,' which may or may not result in arrest. Other times, participants consider 'arrests' that do not ultimately result in charges of official offenses.

# Mental Health/Psychological

## Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)

### BSI Description

The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is designed to reflect psychological symptom patterns of psychiatric and medical patients. The BSI instrument is especially appropriate in clinical situations where debilitation results in reduced attention and endurance, in research with limited interview schedules, and in outpatient clinics where testing procedures demand brevity. The BSI instrument is also frequently used in measuring patient progress during treatment or in the assessment of treatment outcome.

-   For the present study, 19 items from the BSI were collected in order to calculate the **Somatization**, **Anxiety**, and **Depression** raw subscales.

    + **Somatization** reflects distress arising from perceptions of bodily dysfunction.
    + **Anxiety** reflects general signs such as nervousness and tension are included in the Anxiety dimension, as are panic attacks and feelings of terror.
    + **Depression** reflects symptoms of dysphoric mood and affect are represented as are lack of motivation and loss of interest in life.  
&nbsp;

-   Item numbers in this data set may not match original item numbers from the BSI. Please reference this guide to see match with original BSI (original BSI item number in *italics*): 01 = *01*, 02 = *02*, 03 = *07*, 04 = *09*, 05 = *12*, 06 = *16*, 07 = *17*, 08 = *18*, 09 = *19*, 10 = *23*, 11 = *29*, 12 = *30*, 13 = *33*, 14 = *35*, 15 = *37*, 16 = *38*, 17 = *45*, 18 = *49*, 19 = *50* 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   **Higher** scores indicate **more** severe
psychological symptoms.

-   Raw scores can be converted to T scores using the tables provided in the BSI measure documentation.

-   The missing data rule was not applied. The only missing data in this measure reflects responses not collected on `bsi4` due to our protocols for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. According to the BSI manual, up to one item can be missing from each subscale to obtain valid subscale scores.

## Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)

### CES-D Description

The Center for Epidemiological Studies â€“ Depression Scale (CES-D) is a self-report measure with 20 items comprising six scales reflecting major dimensions of depression: depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance.

  * All 20 items from the CES-D were collected and a depression subscale was calculated: **depressive symptoms**. 
  
  * Four items (`c4`, `c8`, `c12`, and `c16`) should be reverse scored which is noted in the variable table below and the reverse scored variables are provided (`c4_r`, `c8_r`, `c12_r`, and `c16_r`). 

  * **Higher** scores indicate the presence of **greater** depression symptoms.

  * Four additional variables (`c21`-`c24`) were included in this section to assess suicidality. Variables `c22` and `c23` are only applicable if
participants responded "Yes" to `c21`.

  * The missing data rule was not applied since all participants had less than 20% missing data. Missing data for each variable is presented in the descriptive statistics table below.

## Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire (CIQ)

### CIQ Description

The CIQ is a self-report survey used to assess the financial, resource, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

*   For the present study, 3 items from the CIQ were collected in order to construct the psychological impacts subscale. We made this decision because data collection launched in the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas prior waves occurred before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

*   `ciq1` should be reverse scored. 

*   **Higher** scores indicate **greater** psychological impacts of COVID-19.

*   The missing data rule was not applied since there is no missing data among CIQ variables.

## Life Events Checklist (LEC-5)

### LEC Description

The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) is a self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a respondent's lifetime. The LEC-5 assesses exposure to 16 events known to potentially result in PTSD or distress and includes one additional item assessing any other extraordinarily stressful event not captured in the first 16 items. In this study, we used a modified version of the LEC-5 extended; we also incorporated two additional items:

-   `LEC_18_...` "Unfairly treated or discriminated against because of your race, ethnicity, or culture"

-   `LEC_17_...` "Unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened or abused by the police"

-   No items in this measure are reverse scored

-   There are 439 LEC-5 items in our data file. Many of these were derived from follow up questions from each of the 19 life events that were asked about.

    + We asked about whether each event was experienced ("happened to me"), witnessed , or learned about. 
    + We asked the developmental time period in which each event was experienced or witnessed (`0-5`, `6-11`, `12-19`, `adulthood`). 
    + We asked about the frequency of the life experience for those events that participants endorsed as having happened to them or those they witnessed.
    + We also asked about the relationship of the participant to the person involved in the life event, only for those events that happened to the participant or those events the participants witnessed. 
  
-   Our datafile also contains computed variables that provide information as to the first developmental period in which an event happened to each participant (ex., `lec1_devperiod`)

-   `lec_total_happen` is a computed total score of the number of life events that happened to each participant. 

-   `lec_total_witness` is a computed total score of the number of life events that each participant witnessed.

## International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ)

### ITQ Description

The ITQ is a 9-item brief questionnaire designed to measure the core features of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

-   For the present study, 9 items from the ITQ were collected. The datafile contains
a total 15 variables related to the ITQ.

-   The language below was used to introduce the ITQ.

>
"I will read a number of problems that people sometimes report in response to traumatic or stressful life events. Please listen carefully and use the response options to indicate how much you have been bothered by that problem in the past month."
>

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   The missing data rule was applied. Calculations were completed for
participants with 33% or less missing data (this includes -77 responses).

-   **Higher** scores reflect **greater** ptsd symptoms.

-   There are several ways to score the ITQ and methods are available in the citation provided below. 

-   One limitation of this measures in the current study is the answer scale shown to participant in this study (see value labels below). We computed criteria for PTSD based on participant endorsement of one symptom within each cluster based on a value of `A little bit 1-2 times per week`. The ITQ criteria differs across empirical studies and users may consider alternate scoring for PTSD diagnostic criteria, but should keep in mind the scale used in the current study.

## Institutional Betrayal Questionnaire (IBQ)

### IBQ Description

The IBQ is a 10-item questionnaire originally designed to measure institutional betrayal that occurs following a sexual assault; however, in the current study we appended this measure to our trauma assessment battery and introduced the measure with the following language to asses institutional betrayal for any type of trauma experience: 

>
"For this section, I will ask you to think about larger institutions or systems which you may have been part of or enrolled in, which may or may not call to mind specific individuals. This may include large systems such as a school or college, the child welfare system, juvenile justice, a medical or mental health clinic, foster care, local police, the legal system, or an organized religion. Additionally, this can refer to parts of these systems such as a specific school or sports club, a specific foster care placement, or a particular church."
>

-   For the present study, 10 items from the IBQ were collected. Additionally, through data cleaning we created 11 additional variables, thus, there are 21 IBQ variables in this dataset.

-   No items need to be reverse scored.  

-   We did not apply the missing data rule to this measure.

## Pregnancy and Childbirth Trauma (PCT)

### PCT Description
  
The Pregnancy and Childbirth Trauma Measure used in this study is an adaptation of the Birth Experiences Questionnaire (*BEQ*; Saxbe et al., 2018). Adaptations include our introduction to the measure to acknowledge that we had asked participants about their pregnancy losses at other assessment waves. Additionally, we included a screening item that asked if the participant considered any prior pregnancy or childbirth loss traumatic. Participants endorsed each child and pregnancy trauma with 'yes' or 'no' rather than on a likert scale.  

-   Because this is a sensitive topic and participants in this study have told us about their pregnancy losses previously, we introduced the measure with the following text:  

>  
**"We know that pregnancy loss and trauma is a much more common experience than is often acknowledged. In this study, we are interested in better understanding any experience that has contributed stress to womenâ€™s lives, so we are going to ask a few follow-up questions about your experiences in pregnancy and childbirth. Remember, you do not have to answer any question that you do not want to answer."**
>   

-   If a participant answered "no" to the screening item `pct1` they skipped this questionnaire (`-55`). 

-   This measure contains 12 items, including one item asking about pregnancies and one screening item.

-   This measure contains two subscales: 

    + `pct_preg_total` is the total number of traumatic pregnancy experiences the participant endorsed. 

    + `pct_childbirth_total` is the total number of traumatic childbirth experiences the participants endorsed. 

-   **Higher** scores represent **greater** pregnancy and childbirth trauma. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment.

-   Missing data rules were applied.

## Posttraumatic Risk Seeking Scale (PRSS)

### PRSS Description

The PRSS is a brief 5-item questionnaire designed to assess the construct of posttraumatic risk-seeking (Kerig, 2019) which proposes that, following trauma exposure, some individuals, particularly youth, engage in behaviors that involve fear-defiance, rushing toward danger, and the cultivation of risky situations that might result in harm to themselves or others. This description was taken from the measure documentation. 

-   Please note that because PRSS is hypothesized to follow from trauma, individuals who do not endorse a trauma exposure will not have valid scores on the measure. Although our study appended the PRSS to other trauma indices, no decision rules were built in, thus individuals who analyze these data should be sure to check variable `lec_total_happen` and `lec_total_witness` to ensure that trauma exposure has occurred and that PRSS data are valid for analysis. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   **Higher** scores indicate **greater** posttraumatic risk-seeking behaviors.

-   There are 6 total items presented below, included the computed total score.

-   The missing data rule was applied. Calculations were completed for participants with 33% or less missing data (this includes `-77` responses)

## Stigma & Shame Questionnaire (SSQ)

### SSQ Description

The SSQ is a 8-item questionnaire designed to measure abuse-related stigma and shame. These emotions are important to assess in the context of trauma exposure given they have been shown to promote cognitive and behavioral avoidance and therefore may contribute to prolonged or exacerbated posttraumatic stress symptoms. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   **Higher** scores indicate **greater** experiences of stigma and shame. 

-   There are 10 total items presented below, included the computed total score `ssq_total` and the empirical cutoff score for high and low shame `ssq_total_cutoff`.

-   The cutoffs for `ssq_total_cutoff` are as follows: >= 12 represents "high shame" and <= 11 represents "low shame." As stated by the measure authors, scores of 12 or higher were considered evidence of high shame because this indicated that a participant felt at least a moderate ('somewhat true') to high levels of shame on at least six of the eight items. 

-   The missing data rule was applied. Calculations were completed for participants with 30% or less missing data (this includes `-77` responses)

# Relationships

## Sex History Survey (SEXEXP)
 
### SEXEXP Description
  
The Sex History Survey was administered as part of the CINT and focuses on the participant's sexual experiences. All questions for SEXEXP were drawn from Capaldi et al., 2002.

-   There are 75 items, which includes items that were created during data cleaning. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   No total scores or subscales were computed, thus the missing data rules were not applied. 

-   For a 5-item health-risking sexual behavior scale suggestion suggestion, please see the Smith et al., 2006 reference below.

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment.

## Social Influences - General (SOCINF-G)

### SOCINF-G Description
  
The SOCINF-G assesses partner influences on delinquent or risky behaviors. There are 17 SOCINF-G items in our data file.

-   No items have been reverse scored. 

-   No missing data rules were applied as no scales were computed. 

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. 

-   Participants who reported being in a relationship in the past six months responded to this survey (`socinf_general_screener` = yes) whereas participants who were not in a relationship in the past six months skipped this survey (`-55` values).

## Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child (CTS P-C)

  
### CTS P-C Description
  
The Conflict Tactics Scale  Parent-Child (CTS P-C) is a 23-item questionnaire which measures how often parents used specific acts of discipline (both violent and nonviolent) with their child in the past year. It does not measure whether or not the child was injured. The CTS P-C also has a supplemental scale on neglect and one on sexual abuse. There are five subscales of the CTS P-C: nonviolent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault, past week discipline, and neglect.

-   Participants responded to all items in this questionnaire if they responded 'yes' to the screening item `cts_parent_screen`, which asked if they had parented a child under the age of 18 in the past year. Skip rules will result in values of `-55` in this screener as a result. 

- There are a total of 75 variables associated with this measure in the dataset, including computed subscales listed below. 

- Values that are recoded have the suffix `_r`

- The missing data rule was not applied to the scoring of subscales in this measure. Data users should examine missing data an apply missing data analyses and methods as appropriate.

- **Higher** scores indicate the **greater** presence of behaviors measured in this questionnaire.

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment.

#### Scale and Subscales

Information on how subscales are presented below in the table and below. 

-   **Prevalence** scales are calculated by summing all values in the associated items when those values are 0 or greater (excluding missing data values).

-   **Count** variables are equivalent to **Prevalence** subscales, which count the presence of each behavior referenced within the set of associated subscale items; thus, an individual only has to report a given behavior 1 or more times for that behavior (item) to be included in the summed **prevalence** subscale score. **Count** variables are only included here to allow for the replication of other subscale scores. 

-   **Mean Chronicity** provides a sort of average chronicity rating by dividing the chronity score of the subscale by the count of that subscale. 

-   **Ever Prevalence** is a count of behaviors (items) within each subscale that have ever occurred for a participant across the lifetime. It is computed by summing behaviors reported only greater than one year ago (`-2` values) together with the **prevalence** of that subscale. Note that `Weekly Discipline` does not have an **ever prevalence** subscale score since it was only asked about for the past week.

-   **Ever Prevalence Greater Than 1 Year** is a count of behaviors (items) within each subscale that have occurred for a participant only in the time period preceding one year ago or earlier. This is an indication of historical prevalence rather than recent prevalence.

## Revised Conflict Tactics Scale - Short Form (CTS2S)

### CTS2S Description

The CTS2S is a self-report measure used to assess tactics used when there is conflict in a relationship.

For the present study, all 20 items from the CTS2S were
collected, and all scales (Negotiation, Physical Assault, and
Psychological Aggression) and supplemental scales (Assault and Sexual Coercion) were calculated. Please see measure documentation for guidance on computing these scales. 

-   There are 21 items archived in the datafile for the CTS2S.

-   The CTS2S does not have a composite score. Instead, CTS2S has three different ways of scoring (Prevalence, Severity, Mutuality).

-   No items need to be reverse scored.

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. 

-   The missing data rule was not applied because computed variables were not created.

-   Authors describe that internal reliability is not appropriate for the CTS2S measure.

## Brief Child Abuse Potential Inventory (BCAP)

### BCAP Description

The BCAP is a 34-item brief version of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI), a self-report inventory used to assess parental child abuse risk.          

-   For the present study, 34 items from the BCAP were
collected. The data file contains 38 items, including the four items that were reverse scored. 

-   Four items should be reverse scored (`bcap1`, `bcap2`, `bcap23`, and `bcap29`). Reverse scored items are included in the data file: `bcap1_r`, `bcap2_r`, `bcap23_r` and `bcap29_r`

-   **Higher** scores indicate **greater** risk for child abuse.  As noted by the measure authors and in alignment with the CAPI, high scores by no means indicate the presence or the immediate likelihood of child maltreatment. The BCAP should be used in conjunction with relevant research on the BCAP.

## Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)

### DAS Description

The DAS is a self-report measure used to assess dyadic adjustment (e.g., interpersonal tensions, dyadic satisfaction, dyadic functioning).

-   For the present study, all 32 items from the DAS were collected, and the **total score** and all subscales are included: **Consensus**, **Affective Expression**, **Satisfaction**, and **Cohesion**, the screener item, to reverse-scored items, thus there are 40 total items.

-   **Higher** scores indicate **more** positive dyadic (couple) adjustment, and **greater** consensus, affective expression, satisfaction, and cohesion in the couple relationship.

-   The missing data rule was applied. See coding script for details. 

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. 

-   There are two reverse scored variables: `das18_r` and `das19_r` and the reverse scored variables archived in this file.

-   Participants who reported they were not currently in a (romantic) relationship, or in a relationship in the past 6 months, were not administered this survey. This screening item is included in the data. 

-   Guidance on clinical cutoffs are presented in the Spanier 1976 article and may be obtained through other empirical papers that use the DAS.

## Attachment Relationships Questionnaire (ARQ)

### ARQ Description

The ARQ is a brief self-report measure used to categorize attachment styles in adulthood. 

-   For the present study, all 5 items from the ARQ were collected in order to construct four attachment styles (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, fearful).

-   There are a total of 8 items, including original items and computed scores.

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   Scoring Information  

    + Participants self-select one attachment style that best describes them in the first question `rq1`, and then rate their agreement with each attachment style for `rqa` - `rqd`.

    + Higher ratings indicate more agreement with the statement.

    + `arq_group` is a variable that represents each participants highest rating for attachment style across `rqa` - `rqd`, Participants were classified into one of four attachment groups (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, fearful). In cases where the participant's highest rating was equivalent across multiple styles, no classficiation was given (`-99`).

    + `arq_model_self_attach_anxiety` Model of the self (i.e., attachment anxiety) was calculated by summing secure and dismissing ratings then subtracting the sum of preoccupied and fearful items. 

    + `arq_model_other_attach_avoid` Model of the other (i.e., attachment avoidance) was constructed by summing secure and preoccupied items and subtracting the sum of dismissing and fearful items. 

    + Postive scores on the two attachment models (self and other) indicate more positive attachment models ad negative scores indicate more negative models. See cited references for more information. 

-   The missing data rule is applied. Calculations were completed for
participants with 20% or less missing data (this includes -77 responses)

## Pregnancy and Parenting Data 

Data on pregnancy and childbirth have been obtained prospectively at each wave of the study. Participants self-reported this information in the current study. 

-   The presence or absence of a pregnancy, stillbirth, induced abortion, miscarriage, and live birth was coded as `1 = yes1` and `0 = no` to indicate presence or absence of a pregnancy or pregnancy outcome that occurred since the last time we had interviewed each participant. 

-   We also provided information from the longitudinal data in aggregate to document the total number of children previously born to the sample. 

-   Data are archived in aggregate to preserve participant and participant offspring confidentiality.

# Services

## Service Utilization Survey (SUS)

### SUS Description

The measure asks about involvement with services, including child welfare services, health and medical services, substance use disorder treatment services, mental health services, and support group services. 


-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   This is not a a standardized questionnaire, so the missing data rules were not applied. No total or subscales were computed. 

-   We are not presenting `sus14` items because those contain privately identifiable information that cannot be sufficiently de-identified. 

-   There are a total of 69 SUS variables in this datafile.

# Substance Use

## The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)

### DAST Description

The DAST was designed to provide a brief instrument for clinical and non-clinical screening to detect drug use disorders. It is most useful in settings in which seeking treatment for drug use problems is not the patientâ€™s stated goal. It was adapted from the MAST to detect drug use disorders to a range of psychoactive substances other than alcohol. The 20-item version of the DAST used in the current study was found to have psychometric properties comparable with the original 28-item version.

-   For the present study, 22 items from the DAST were collected and a total score (`dast_total`) was constructed as well as a categorical variable representing drug use severity (`dast_total_r`). There are 25 items in the datefile, included the dast screener, the original dast items, the reverse scored variables, and the two computed variables.

-   Two items (`d4` and `d5`) should to be reverse scored. The reverse scored variables are saved in the dataset (`d4_r` and `d5_r`). 

-   Higher scores indicate more problems related to drug use.

-   Participants who were incarcerated at the time of the interview were not administered this survey.

-   The missing data rule was applied. Calculations were completed only with participants that had less than 20% missing data (this includes `-77` responses). Only one participant was missing data due to a `-77` declined response, whereas all other participants with missing data did not complete the survey due to skip rules (`-55`).

### DAST Variables

#### Value Labels

All The DAST variables have the same response options.

```{r DAST-label-table, results = 'asis'}

            "Yes")) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

dast_label_df <- setNames(dast_label_df[-1, ], unlist(dast_label_df[1, ]))


#create table
dast_label_table <- dast_label_df %>%

  tab_options(table.border.top.width = 1, table.border.bottom.width = 1,
              table.border.left.width = 1, table.border.right.width = 1) %>% 
  cols_width(everything() ~ px(180)) %>% 
  apply_labtab_theme()

# Print the table

## Social Influences - Substances (SOCINF-S)
  
### SOCINF-S Description
 
The SOCINF-S assesses partner influences on substance use behaviors. There are 70 SOCINF-S items in our data file.

-   No items have been reverse scored. 

-   No missing data rules were applied as no scales were computed. 

-   This survey was not administered for participants who were incarcerated at the time of the assessment. 

-   Participants responded to this questionnaire if they met two criteria. First, participants must have reported being in a relationship in the past six months responded to this survey (`socinf_relationship_screener` = "Yes") and could not be currently pregnant (`socinf_preg_screener` = "No"). Participants who did not meet these criteria skipped past this survey (`-55` values).

# Well-Being


## Mental Health Continuum - Short Form (MHC-SF)

### MHC Description

The MHC-SF is a 14-item questionnaire designed to measure positive mental health. As stated by the measure authors, the MHC-SF consists of 14 items that were selected to represent each facet of well-being. The MHC-SF was derived from the MHC long form (40 items). 

-   The short form consists of 3 emotional well-being items (`mhc_pa`; reflects hedonic well-being), 6 psychological well-being items (`mhc_pwb`), and 5 social well-being items (`mhc_swb`). When social and psychological well-being are combined, they reflect eudemonic well-being.

-   Please see measure documentation to compute flourishing and languishing mental health indicators based on these three subscales. These computations and variables are not included in our documentation. 

-   For the present study, 14 items from the MHC were collected. The data file contains a total of 18 items, including computed variables. 

-   No items need to be reverse scored. 

-   **Higher** scores indicate **better** mental health.

-   The missing data rule was applied, including for `-77` responses.

## Flourishing Index (FI)

### FI Description

The Flourishing Index is a 12-item questionnaire designed to measure five domains of flourishing. The scale contains 2 items for each domain, including happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social relationships. There are also two items that represent "secure flourish" indicating financial and material stability, noted by the measure authors to help individuals sustain flourishing across other domains captured through the measure. Scale authors note that questions were selected primarily from among existing questions that have some empirical validation and that are widely used in the well-being literature. 

-   The dataset contains 14 FLO items, including the Flourishing Index `flo_total` and the Secure Flourish Index `secure_flourish`.

-   Although not computed in our data file, subscales based on the five domains can be computed. See the measure reference for additional scoring details. 
  
-   No items need to be reverse scored. 
  
-   **Higher** scores indicate **greater** flourishing.

-   The missing data rule was applied. Calculations were completed for participants with 20% or less missing data (this includes -77 responses)

#### Survey Items

FLO survey items are presented in the following table:

```{r flo-var-prep}
# Pull question wording from qualtrics data
flo_word <- qualtrics %>% 
  select(I1:I12)%>%
  # changing prefix to align "i" to "flo"
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "^I", "flo"), matches("^I\\d")) %>%
  slice(1)

#create table with variable name, description, and notes

flo_word_long <- flo_word %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "var_name",
               values_to = "description") %>% 
  mutate(description = str_replace(description, "^\\d+\\.\\s*", ""),
         var_name = str_to_lower(var_name), 
         notes = as.character("")) %>% 
  mutate(notes = gsub("^.*Note: ", "", description),  # Extract text after "Note:" into "notes"
         description = gsub("Note:.*$", "", description)) %>%
  slice(1:12)

```

```{r flo-var-table, results ='asis'}
# Create the gt table object and apply generic theme
flo_gt_table <- gt(flo_word_long)

# Table-specific formatting (col width, names)
flo_gt_table <- flo_gt_table %>% 
  cols_label(var_name = "Variable", 
             description = "Description",
             notes = "Notes") %>% 
  apply_tbl_theme() %>% 
  cols_width(notes ~ px(150),

  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left"), locations = cells_column_labels())

# Print the table

```

#### Scale and Subscales

Information on the total score is below.
Variables were constructed by summing included items.
```{r  flo, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
flo_complete <- complete %>%
  select(flo1:flo12, flo_total,secure_flourish)
```

```{r flo alpha, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Calculate internal reliability 
flo_alpha <- flo_complete %>%
  select(flo1:flo10) %>% 
  filter(across(everything(), ~. >= 0)) %>%
  psych::alpha(check.keys = TRUE)

flo_sf_alpha <- flo_complete %>% 
  select(flo1:flo12) %>%
  filter(across(everything(), ~. >= 0)) %>%
  psych::alpha(check.keys = TRUE)
```

```{r flo-scale-table, results = 'asis'}
# Create the table as a data frame
flo_scale_df <- data.frame(
  var_name = c("flo_total", "secure_flourish"),
  scale = c("FLO Total (10)","Secure Flourish (12)"),
  scale_construction = c(" `flo1`, `flo2`, `flo3`, `flo4`, `flo5`, `flo6`, `flo7`, `flo8`, `flo9`, `flo10`",
                         "`flo1`, `flo2`, `flo3`, `flo4`, `flo5`, `flo6`, `flo7`, `flo8`, `flo9`, `flo10`, `flo11`, `flo12`,`flo11`, `flo12`"),
  scale_range = c("0-100", "0-120"), 
  alpha = c(round(flo_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3),
            round(flo_sf_alpha$total$raw_alpha, 3))
)




# Create the gt table object
flo_scale_df <- gt(flo_scale_df) %>%
  cols_align(columns = c("scale_range"), align = "center") %>% 
  cols_label(var_name = "Variable Name",
             scale = "Scale (# of items)", 
             scale_construction = "Scale Construction",
             scale_range = "Range*",
             alpha = "Alpha"
             ) %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "*Range of possible values") %>% 
#  tab_options(table.border.bottom.style = "hidden") %>% 
  cols_width(scale ~ px(135)) %>% 
  apply_tbl_theme() 

# Print the table
print(flo_scale_df)
```

### Summary Statistics

#### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are presented below for each item and the total score:

```{r flo-mean-items}
# Calculate the summary statistics for each variable
flo_summary_data <- lapply(flo_complete, function(x) {
  x <- replace(x, (x < -40 & x!= -55 & x!= -88), NA)  # Your original recoding
  x <- replace(x, (x == "-44" | x== "-77" | x== "-99"), NA)  # Additional recoding
  # Exclude negative values and specific negative values from calculations
  x_no_negatives <- replace(x, (x < 0 | x == -44 | x == -77 | x == -99), NA)
  mean_val <- ifelse(all(is.na(x_no_negatives)), NA, sprintf("%.2f", round(mean(x_no_negatives, na.rm = TRUE), 2)))
  sd_val <- ifelse(all(is.na(x_no_negatives)), NA, round(sd(x_no_negatives, na.rm = TRUE), 2))
  range_val <- ifelse(all(is.na(x_no_negatives)), NA, paste(min(x_no_negatives, na.rm = TRUE), max(x_no_negatives, na.rm = TRUE), sep = "-"))
  miss_val <- round(mean(is.na(x)) * 100, 2)  # Calculate missing value percentage using original x
  c(Mean = mean_val, SD = sd_val, Range = range_val, Missing = paste(miss_val, "%", sep = ""))
})

# Convert summary_data to a data frame
flo_summary_data <- as.data.frame(flo_summary_data)

# Set items as first row
flo_summary_data <- rbind(names(flo_summary_data), flo_summary_data) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# Create the gt table
flo_tbl <- flo_summary_data %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(`1` = "Variable",
             Range = "Range*",
             Missing = "% Missing") %>% 
  cols_width(everything() ~ pct(100)) %>%
  cols_align(columns = c("Mean", "SD", "Range", "Missing"), align = "center") %>% 
  tab_footnote("*Range of data values") %>% 
  tab_options(table.border.bottom.style = "hidden") %>%
  apply_tbl_theme()

# Render the table
flo_tbl

```

#### Distributions


```{r flo-distributions, class.source='fold', echo = FALSE}
p_flo_complete <- flo_complete %>%
  filter(flo_total >= 0) %>%
  composite_hist(
    x = flo_total
  ) +
  labs(title = 'Total Scores for Flourishing Index')

p_flo_sf_complete <- flo_complete %>%
  filter(secure_flourish >= 0) %>%
  composite_hist(
    x = secure_flourish
  ) +
  labs(title = 'Secure Flourish')

ggarrange(p_flo_complete, p_flo_sf_complete + rremove("ylab")
          ) %>%
  annotate_figure(top = text_grob( "Distribution for Flourishing Index and Flourish Secure Index\n(x-axis and y-axis are in different scales)"))
```
